|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mapFile                | String <br /> The relative path to the file that describes the grid environment input. We use the grid map format as described in the next section (with a section link to the relevant section)                                                                                                                                                                  |
| agentFile              | String <br /> The relative path to the file that describes the start locations for robots. The first line indicates the number of robots n. The following n lines correspond to the start locations of the n robots..* |
| taskFile               | String <br /> The relative path to the file that describes the locations for tasks. The first line indicates the number of tasks m. The following m lines contain single integers that correspond to the locations of the m tasks on the grid.\*               |
| numTasksReveal         | Int (=1) <br /> The number of tasks/errands revealed to a robot at any one time. Every time a robot finishes a task/errand a new task is revealed. By default, this is 1, which means only the next 1 task/errand is known to the robot.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| taskAssignmentStrategy | String (=roundrobin) <br /> The strategy for assigning tasks (`greedy`,`roundrobin` or `roundrobin-fixed`). Every time a robot finishes a task/errand, a task assignment strategy decides the next task assigned to the robot.  `greedy` will assign the next unassigned task from task file line by line. While for `roundrobin` and `roundrobin-fixed`, tasks assignment is pre-decided by the system using a round-robin strategy, where the $i_{th}$ robot will get the $i + n_i*(team size)$ task and $n_i$ is the task counter for robot $i$, starts from 0 and growth by 1 upon a task finish. The difference between "roundrobin" and "roundrobin-fixed" is that for "roundrobin-fixed", the simulation will stop when all the tasks from the task files are finished, and for "roundrobin" the task assignment system will iteratively read the task file from the first line to simulate planning for "infinite" tasks/errands.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| teamSize               | Int <br /> The number of robots in the simulation                                                                                                                                                                                                       |


\* We linearize the a 2-D coordinate and use a single integer to represent a location. Given a location (row,column) and the map height (total number of rows) and width (total number of columns), the linearized location = row*width+column.

## Map File Format

All maps begin with the lines:

> type octile <br />
> height y <br />
> width x <br />
